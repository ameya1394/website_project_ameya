        <span>Fintricity is a Digital Transformation advisory based out of London, UK. I worked within the Fintricity
          Ventures division on a new startup called Kendra Labs. Kendra Labs is a Data & Enterprise AI platform that

        <span>As a Product Marketing & Strategy intern I conducted extensive market research and competitor analysis to
          define our value proposition, develop product offerings, and map out the platform ecosystem. My market
          analysis led me to define 2 product offerings - The Kendra Labs Sustainability Platform, and the AI Customer
          Data Platform. Within these verticals, I was able to define product features, influence and prioritize product
          development roadmaps, and define Go-To-Market strategies. Furthermore, my research prompted me to write a
          white paper on the importance of Data for firms to realize their Sustainability goals as thought leadership
          content for the Kendra Labs blog. </span>
